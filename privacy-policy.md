# Privacy Policy
We do not upload, track, or collect. Your calendar data always stays on your device.

## Introduction

ChronoGraph is a minimalist tool focused on schedule visualization and private sharing. We take privacy seriously—since day one, the app has followed data minimization and fully on‑device processing principles. This document explains what the app can access, how it is handled, and how you can control it.

## Data Access Scope

The app reads only the calendars you authorize. It does not write, modify, or delete any events; it does not access Reminders, Contacts, Location, or other data types.

## On‑device Processing

All event reading, filtering, privacy‑mode processing (hidden/partial/full), and image rendering are performed locally on your device. We operate no servers, and we do not upload any event titles, times, attendees, notes, or metadata to the network.

## Collection & Sharing

We do not collect, store, aggregate, or analyze any user's calendar data, usage behavior, or diagnostic content. Unless you explicitly consent, the app will not provide data to third parties for analytics, advertising, tracking pixels, or fingerprinting technologies; we also do not run our own backend.

## Permissions

On first use, you must explicitly grant access to Calendars. This system permission can be revoked at any time in Settings > Privacy & Security > Calendars. After revocation, the app can still launch but cannot display or export events.

## Your Controls

You can:

* Choose exactly which calendars participate in visualization;
* Switch privacy display modes at any time;
* Collapse dates without events to reduce exposure;
* Disable permission or re‑authorize at any time.

The app does not cache detailed fields that have been hidden.

## Image Export & Sharing

Exported images are generated on the device. Sharing uses the system share sheet; only when you actively choose a sharing destination will an image leave your device. We never automatically upload exported results.

## Logs & Diagnostics

By default, the app does not write logs containing personal event content. If we introduce optional diagnostic uploads in the future to improve stability, we will seek your explicit consent again and allow you to turn it off at any time.

## Policy Changes

If we plan to introduce features that require network transmission or data persistence (e.g., cloud sync), we will notify you in a prominent place in the app before any change and seek your consent again. Without your consent, we will not reduce the current level of privacy protection.

## Compliance

This policy conforms to:

* App Store Review Guidelines 5.1.1 (data minimization principle);
* General best practices for data localization and minimization. Because there is no server and zero collection, data‑subject access and deletion request scenarios under GDPR/CCPA do not arise.
